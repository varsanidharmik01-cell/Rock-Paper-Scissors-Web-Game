Developed an interactive Rock Paper Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The project allows users to play against the computer with real-time score tracking and instant feedback.
The user interface is designed to be simple, responsive, and engaging, while the game logic handles random computer moves, win/ loss conditions, and draw scenarios.
